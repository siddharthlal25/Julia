#k number of variables
#N number of samples
#rl is row vector of size k consisting of lower bounds variables
#ru is row vector of size k consisting of upper bounds of variables


#the user needs to define the function as funct(x) outside the code
#and then call the function DGSM

#for example
#funct(x) = 5*x[1]+x[2]^2
#DGSM(2,400000,[2.0 5.0],[7.0 11.0])

#a dgsm with 2 variables 400000 samples and the range of x[1] is from 2 to 7 and range of x[2] is from 5 to 11
